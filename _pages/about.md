I'm a Postdoctoral Fellow with the NSF Research Training Group (RTG) in Mathematical Foundations of Data Science at the [University of South Carolina](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/mathematics/index.php). I recently earned my PhD in Mathematics from USC, where I worked under the advisement of [Dr. Linyuan Lu](https://people.math.sc.edu/lu/).

My research is in extremal combinatorics, with a focus on graphs and hypergraphs. In particular, my research interests include

- **Spectral Graph Theory:** linear combinations of eigenvalues over families of graphs,
- **Extremal Problems in Hypergraph Theory:** Turán-type questions, including those formulated in the ℓ<sub>2</sub>-norm,
- **Discrete Curvature in Graphs:** structural and quantitative properties of graphs with positive Lin-Lu-Yau curvature.

Beyond research, I am committed to teaching and mentorship. I have mentored students through USC's Summer REU in Mathematical Foundations of Data Science and the Opportunity Scholars Program, and I have supported graduate teaching development through USC's Peer Mentor program. I have also helped coordinate Python labs and Gateway exams for calculus courses, as well as provided support for the Math Tutoring Center and the Math Assessment of Prerequisites.
